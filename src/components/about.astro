				I have been balling for my whole career. I am working as a front-end
				developer intern. I'm very interested in cutting edge technology and
				hope to one day be able to contribute to a company pushing the current
				limits. I began coding with python when I was in highschool, introduced
				through <span class="text-rose-400 underline hover:text-rose-500"
					><a
						href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/sneaker-bot/"
						rel="noreferrer"

					></span>, and enrolled at Oakland University
			 to take my skills further. I have since been working through college,
			taking multiple programming jobs and learning as much as I can outside of school.
