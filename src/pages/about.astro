					<h2>Before</h2>
					<p class="md:text-md lg:text-lg">
						My life, in a professional sense, didn't really start until college,
						but we’ll get there. In elementary and middle school my sole focus
						was my personal enjoyment. Every second of every day was spent doing
						exactly what I wanted to do which usually consisted of soccer,
						diving, friends, or <span class="text-sky-300 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-sky-400"

								>Minecraft PvP</a
							></span
						>. In Highschool, my focus shifted a bit. I now had commitments that
						were generally outside the realm of enjoyment. I stopped going to
						the pool and quit soccer and instead started working and spending
						more of my time online playing games and reselling shoes(link to
						humble beginnings blog post /shop.soles). While my time spent online
						can generally be seen as a waste of time, this is where I discovered
						the world of programming and learned how to find and interact with
						communities I was interested in to help deepen my understanding and
						find people that share interests and ideas.

					<p class="md:text-md lg:text-lg">
						Beginning in college, I still held many of the same tendencies.
						Powered by online school, I would sit on my computer doing nothing
						but school and video games for an ungodly amount of time each day. I
						tried learning Python and Java but couldn’t bring myself to do
						anything productive. The depressing state of the world got to me and
						I wasn’t doing shit. Fast forward to the next year and I randomly
						ended up in a gym one day and randomly ended up with a job teaching
						programming. These two things alone turned my life around and got me
						back being productive and actually enjoying it. It’s only been a
						year since then and I’ve made progress in both respective areas that
						I could only dream of, and found enjoyment in the process of
						bettering myself.

						5th grade me is still trying to come to terms with sitting in a
						chair for a good portion of the day, and 12th grade me is still
						trying to get over the fear of judgement, but current me is looking
						at every coming day as an opportunity to push myself and stay
						consistent to the methods that have landed me great internships and
						great improvement. Rewrite this but yeah. I want to rise to the top
						of whatever I might be doing at the time. Whatever I do, I wanna be
						great.
