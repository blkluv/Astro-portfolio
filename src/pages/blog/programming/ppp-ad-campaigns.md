According to a study by [Lumio](https://lunio.ai/blog/strategy/wasted-ad-spend/#:~:text=are%20generally%20higher.-,4.,make%20data%2Ddriven%20campaign%20optimsations.) 10 – 20% of ad spend is wasted on clicks from bots and fake user profiles. These bad clicks also distort your analytics, making it harder to make data-driven campaign optimizations.

### Solution

You only pay for the results of videos made using your branded AR effect filter. $0 down to get started for $LUV holders. You only pay every 30 days based on your PPP campaign's proven performance results on TikTok, Instagram or Facebook.

### PPP (Pay Per Posts)

As a solution to this industry pain point we created a new marketing campaign protocol called PPP®️ (pay per posts) which means you only pay per posts made using your custom branded AR effect filter 30 days after of the start of your social media marketing campaign.

### TOP 5% TIKTOK CREATORS

The Arvrtise analytics dashboard displays the level of engagement for AR effect filter campaigns worldwide. Arvrtise is currently ranked in the top 5% of effect creators on the number one search engine, TikTok.

### Arvrtise Idol

Challenge your customers or fans to create the best Reel using your branded AR effect filter Arvrtise Idol style. Let your followers be judge of the winner by voting on the reel.

We reward the top creators with free $LUV that can't be purchased on an exchange. $LUV can be redeemed for products or services on Web5 https://luvnft.com or on https://arvrtise.com.

We can even host your Arvrtise Idol event in our Metaverse space.

### Pricing

Our solution to help unfunded businesses have an equal opportunity to compete with funded businesses is the creation of a $3 million PPP ad grant exclusively for unfunded companies.

Unfunded businesses can apply for a grant or pay for an ad campaign with $LUV. One $LUV is the equivalent of one US dollar.

Funded businesses can convert fiat to $LUV to save $5 per post.

The PPP (pay per post) fee is $20.00.

For example, if your AR effect was posted 200 times x PPP fee of $20.00, the monthly cost of the campaign would be $4,000.
