THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. HERE ARE SOME THOUGHTS ON HOW AI WILL CHANGE OUR SOCIETY



I mean, yes, it is. But you'll still have a job.

Companies that take up a huge market share are actually generally good for their respective ecosystems, and I don’t know how much of a hot take this is, but while it’s sad that the web is no longer unique, it makes the special projects all the more special. 

For example, when the Loom came out, people making shirts to keep people clothed were fresh out of luck, but those making specialty pieces became even more in demand, because everything else became bland. In the same way, Wordpress has standardized the web, but allowed for skilled creators to become even more in demand and their work strands out more than it did before. I share the same sentiment with the singularity. When AI inevitably “takes” our jobs, I imagine it will be a lot like how Wordpress took the jobs of mediocre web developers, and the loom took the jobs of mediocre shirt makers. If you’re good at what you do, can do some critical thinking, and have a want for 

We’ve seen lots of tech layoffs in the past year, and it’s sad the way that people are being treated with this, the companies are really only worried about their bottom line, and you can’t blame them. These companies were very bloated and laying off 6000 people making 100k a year isn’t anything to scoff at. It feels bad to say, but if you’re not keeping up with tech that you could be using, your job might already be automated and you aren’t a necessary asset. A lot of 50 and 60 year old’s got into tech using lotus notes and VBA, and that shit is just outdated. If they haven’t taken the time between then and now to learn something new, they can’t put these places at fault for letting them go. Some jobs move much slower, and it’s easy to coast and stay employed, but they knew what they were getting into when they got into tech and they know it moves fast. A little rant and idk who’s actually getting laid off but, I feel like if you do good work and you stay above average and make meaningful contributions, you’ll have a lot of job security still. 

AI is going to change everything, or maybe it won’t. But assuming it will, we aren’t all fucked, we just don’t know what to expect yet. New jobs will come and old jobs will go as they always have. I haven’t lived through a major paradigm shift like the industrial revolution, but I imagine this is the same sort of sentiment from the people of that time when everything started moving. Then again, there was no risk of trains becoming sentient and torturing us for all that we have done to them.

Reminds me a bit about the first movie that was shown. It was a video of a train moving, and everyone in the theatre jumped out of their seat because they thought they were going to get hit by a train. It’s so obvious now, but technology like that was horrifying at a first glance. Hopefully it’s the same sort of thing. IDK, we need to treat this the same way we treat nukes and we are already off to a bad start. I'd like to get a closer look at what AGI really entails but I always end up with a feeling of doom when I watch AI youtube videos so perhaps another day.

The fact of the matter is we have always overcome. Human kind has not yet been wiped out and it's not completely off the table, but we are pretty good at not letting things make us extinct.
