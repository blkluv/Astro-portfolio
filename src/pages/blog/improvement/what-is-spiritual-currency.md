Understanding currency in another realm can be challenging, particularly when many of us weren't initially taught about fiat currency. Our currency is a blend of our beliefs and our commitment to pursuing what we love.

As we evolve consciously, our responsibility is to educate ourselves while aiding others, without seeking personal gain from our knowledge.

Humanity shares a collective consciousness; serving others enhances our spiritual wealth from within, ensuring we are fully rewarded for our acts of kindness, unlike what our profit-driven economy might have taught us.

Our business profit economy mirrors our purpose economy, where we become the architects of our own reality by learning to mint spiritual currency based on our beliefs. Our affinity for technology stems from its resemblance to our spiritual nature, much like Marvel movies. Anything AI, blockchain, or a Marvel superhero can do, we too can achieve when we collectively shed self-imposed limitations and envision possibilities. Imagine the impact of three million people uniting on the same high frequency to spread $LUV and propel humanity forward.

By withholding our innate talents from helping others, we limit our spiritual currency tenfold. Constraining our spiritual currency happens when we impose a ceiling on the worth of our time and energy. Billionaires turn to Astrology because market charts are rooted in understanding the life cycles of humanity based on celestial patterns. Spirituality was once stigmatized by the media, yet it holds the power behind much of what we already comprehend.

In the profit economy, money flowed out faster than it came because our methods of generating it lacked authenticity based on how it was manifested with the thought of us needing to work hard for it.

✨ When we work on something when we're tired we deplete our spiritual currency of what we're working on.

Here's a spoiler alert: one of life's biggest lessons is "Knowing Thyself." Why? Because understanding that you are the creator of your reality fueled by imagination makes you more aware of your superpower and its potential for the greater good. Everything created on blockchain endures eternally. As leaders in blockchain, we've pioneered a new economy and business model that benefits all. Check out our Web5 AR 3D Map [Business Map Link](https://map.arvrtise.com) to find upcoming business who accept our $LUV.

## Spiritual Credit

One $LUV acts as a spiritual credit score to weed out A.I. or people that aren't aligned with our purpose as a collective tribe. 

✨The quickest way to deplete our spiritual currency is by exchanging our currency of enegy with anyone that isnt on our same frequency of energy. As a conscious shopper I want to know a businesses LUV account number so I can use a polygon blockchain explorer to see how much $LUV they have. This simply means based on how much invested a company is in the Web5 purpose economy by donating products live on our social media platforms the more $LUV they will have and they will accept your UBI (Universal basic income) as a form of payment. Everyone wins. 


## AI Takeover

Everyone who is replaced by AI will eventually gravitate to the purpose economy that is clear free from AI replacing us from our higher purpose in life.
