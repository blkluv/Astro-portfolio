In 1905, Albert Einstein revealed in his Special Theory of Relativity that space and time are deeply intertwined through the universal speed limit of light, indicating that we exist in a four-dimensional space-time Universe. Despite this, for practical purposes, we typically perceive our Universe in three spatial dimensions (up-down, east-west, north-south) alongside one temporal dimension (past-future). Therefore, LUV NFT has built Web5 in the fifth dimension, manifested by Hahz & Candy as an additional spatial dimension.

History seems to be echoing itself in the realms of technology, spirituality, and music, with creators from past dimensions forming like Voltron to contribute to Web5 powered by $LUV, the only true currency in the 5D universe.
In terms of technology, the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) ancestors introduced advanced technology that existed in the fifth dimension of our consciousness. This knowledge remained dormant until humanity elevated its consciousness to a level capable of comprehending and explaining it to the masses. The Wizard of Hahz teaches that blockchain represents a higher state of consciousness, accessible only to those operating on an elevated frequency of energy. This allows them to perceive its true value and the financial freedom it offers, contrasting sharply with Web2 powered by contracts that have remained unchanged since the era of slavery.

Regarding spirituality, Gen Z prioritizes purpose over profit, considered spiritually as generational Karma. Meanwhile, Baby Boomers aim to retire, passing assets down to their children who would prefer owning a $700k LUV NFT over a $700k home.

> Values in our society have changed, purpose is the new profit. Social media creators are revealing age-old business industry secrets for likes and followers. AI is in full motion of replacing 90% of our current workforce. Amazon replaced 700k employees with AI robots. LUV NFT is creating innovative solutions to create new sources of income for those laid off by AI or in need of spiritual healing and currency. - The Wizard of Hahz


## Music Industry

Currently, Hip Hop sales are declining due to the lower frequency linked to the vibrational energy of the music. Earth has transitioned into the 5th dimension planet-wise, with the former 3D Earth seemingly dissolved akin to a Thanos snap as of 2020. In Kemetic history, Sound Healing constituted the music of healers, where the energy's frequency facilitated spiritual healing among people.

Andre 3000 just confirmed the ushering in of Sound Healing with his latest album "New Blue Sun" which was the equivalent of the universe letting the conscious spiritual community know that the vibration of love is back. Andre 3000 instrumental project debuted at No. 30 on the Billboard 200, moving 24,244 album-equivalent units in its opening week.

As [reported](https://hitsdailydouble.com/sales_plus_streaming) by Hits Daily Double, New Blue Sun debuted at No. 30 on the Billboard 200 this week after moving 24,244 album-equivalent units.

Even more, 3 Stacks' latest offering managed to outsell recent albums from rappers such as Lil Wayne, Nas, Kodak Black, Westside Gunn, Ice Spice, Lil Tjay, and more. With little promo and no traditional industrial marketing what Andre 3000 did sales wise will be talked about and honored in 10 years from now historically.

## HealXYZ

LUV NFT is looking to sign flute artists to blockchain to usher in sound healing music on Web5 under HealXYZ.com that has the fastest growing TikTok spiritual social media platform.
Hahz Terry has deep roots in the music industry, being closely related to Nile Rodgers of Daft Punk as his first cousin and having Sammy Benskin as his grandfather. Sammy Benskin recorded "The Clouds," which climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart, marking a historic milestone as the first number one on any chart released by an African-American owned independent record label. This achievement predates Motown's first No. 1 by a year. There's a prevailing public perception that Motown was the first African-American owned label to top the charts solely for profitable reasons, shifting the narrative around who initially reached the #1 spot.
