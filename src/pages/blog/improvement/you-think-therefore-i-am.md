Earlier in the week, I asked myself this question: is delusion really a bad thing if it benefits you? If I gain confidence from people telling me that I’m smart, does the possibility that they were being sarcastic really matter? I asked some people, thinking the answer was straightforward, but the responses I got led me to digging a bit deeper and thinking of it from multiple perspectives. It’s still opinionated, but here’s what I came up with.

### You can’t help but care
In a perfect world everyone would know their own worth and act accordingly, placing no value on other peoples opinions - but alas, the world is not perfect. Every single person, bar none, pays some level of attention to what people say, and it’s actually advantageous to do so. To fit in and be productive in communication, you are inclined to take feedback from others and change yourself accordingly. You can’t change the fact that you place value on others opinions (even if only subconsciously), but you can change the people you surround yourself with. Most of your personality, self worth, and motivation should come from within - but since it can’t ALL come from within, it’s good to know when people are giving you undeserved or untruthful feedback.

## When you need to change your environment
Receiving consistent feedback when the person providing it stands to gain something should always be taken wearily. The most common occurrences I personally observe are people sucking up to those who have what they desire, or those who can help them accomplish their goals (usually monetarily or in status), men overly complimenting or validating women to court their attention, or people putting others down to feel better about themselves. In all of these instances, the person giving the feedback has only themselves in mind and their feedback should be taken with a grain of salt.

## When you need to change yourself
When its in moderation and from people you trust, feedback should carry more weight. If people you trust to tell you the truth tell you that you’re doing good, or that you’re dropping the ball, you should accept that as real constructive feedback and either pat yourself on the back or consider what they’re saying and take action to change. When the feedback from these people overwhelmingly does not align with the way you view yourself, you may need to be truer with yourself and try understanding other perspectives.

## Feedback is an enhancer, not a baseline
At the end of the day, you are your own person and the vast majority of your analysis and action should be based in your own experiences, successes and shortcomings. By and large, feedback is based in reality, and a majority of what others say trends with what you already know. Either way, though, take feedback in a positive way. If you’re getting shit on, you’re probably doing something wrong and you should be thankful people are telling you what you need to know, and if you’re getting praised, know you’re doing something right and give yourself more confidence in pursuing more of that.
