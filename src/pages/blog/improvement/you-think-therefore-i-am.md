is delusion really a bad thing if it benefits you? If I gain confidence from people telling me that I’m smart, does the possibility that they were lying or being sarcastic really matter?

### You can't help it
In a perfect world everyone would know their own worth and act accordingly, placing no value on other peoples opinions - but alas, the world is not perfect. Every single person, bar none, pays some level of attention to what people say, and it's actually advantageous to do so. To fit in and be productive in communication, you are inclined to take feedback from others and change your personality accordingly. You might say "but I don't want to fit in" to which I reply: Yes, you do. Your niche interests and esoteric knowledge doesn't absolve your need to contribute to society.
Anyway, my point is that you can't change the fact that you place value on other opinions, but you can change the people you surround yourself with.
Most of your personality, self worth, and motivation should come from within, but since it can't ALL come from within, it's good to know when people are giving you undeserved or untruthful feedback, versus when they're telling you the truth and being fair.

## When you need to change your friends
too much praise - they want something from you, your hanging out with people too far beneath you and getting complacent.
when its too much or undeserved (parents shitting on kids or dudes inflating females egos or treating rich people differently)

## When you need to change yourself
When its in moderation and deserved. If people you trust to tell you the truth tell you that you're doing good, or that you're dropping the ball, you should accept that as real constructive feedback and either pat yourself on the back or consider what they're saying and take action to change.

## Conclusion

Outline
- Say that we cant avoid 
  - Everyone is influenced by others thoughts of themselves, no exceptions.
- When it's good
  - When its in moderation and deserved 
- when its bad 
  - when its too much or undeserved (parents shitting on kids or dudes inflating females egos or treating rich people differently)
- how to fix the bad
  - Change your environment. I believe its far easier to change your surroundings and the people you interact with than it is to try to not be influenced by others.

## Yes and No
If someone is constantly bombarded by unjust praise or criticism, it's likely to corrupt their perception of themselves, but for the most that doesn't happen. Although I can think of some cases (usually when the one giving unjust validation stands to gain something), most of everyone receives praise and criticism in moderate and deserved amounts.



The fact that you conform to peoples standards is just that: A fact. 

This has become a common theme among my blog posts, but I am a heavy advocate for the fact that changing your environment is much easier than changing your mind. You’re always going to be influenced by the people around you, so make sure you surround yourself with people who validate your identity and push you to grow. 

People in my life have always told me I was smart or special or would go on to do great things, or maybe they haven’t, and I just took my parent praise too seriously. I was always regarded as smart among my family and my friends and was congratulated for how little work I had to put in the achieve the same results. While most of this genuinely came naturally,  through exploration as a kid and interest in learning, I attribute my ability to learn more rapidly on the fact that for the sake of the identity others were giving me, I leaned into methods that allowed me to learn the least and produce the same results…

I know there is a large conglomerate of people who’s family points out their flaws and tell them they need to be better. From the parents perspective, they are simply trying to push their child to be who they imagined them to be. But I think this is the wrong approach completely, and should be viewed on the contrary. If your kid is stupid, you shouldn’t tell them to be more like their smart friend, but instead find what will make them smart (I believe everyone has the capacity to be exceptionally smart).
