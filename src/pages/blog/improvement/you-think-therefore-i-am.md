is delusion really a bad thing if it benefits you? If I gain confidence from people telling me that I’m smart and use that to my advantage, does the possibility that they were lying or being sarcastic really matter?



The fact that you conform to peoples standards is just that: A fact. 

This has become a common theme among my blog posts, but I am a heavy advocate for the fact that changing your environment is much easier than changing your mind. You’re always going to be influenced by the people around you, so make sure you surround yourself with people who validate your identity and push you to grow. 

People in my life have always told me I was smart or special or would go on to do great things, or maybe they haven’t, and I just took my parent praise too seriously. I was always regarded as smart among my family and my friends and was congratulated for how little work I had to put in the achieve the same results. While most of this genuinely came naturally,  through exploration as a kid and interest in learning, I attribute my ability to learn more rapidly on the fact that for the sake of the identity others were giving me, I leaned into methods that allowed me to learn the least and produce the same results…

I know there is a large conglomerate of people who’s family points out their flaws and tell them they need to be better. From the parents perspective, they are simply trying to push their child to be who they imagined them to be. But I think this is the wrong approach completely, and should be viewed on the contrary. If your kid is stupid, you shouldn’t tell them to be more like their smart friend, but instead find what will make them smart (I believe everyone has the capacity to be exceptionally smart).
