Purpose is the driving force behind our personal motivation to create value. It's an intricate tapestry woven from various sources that are deeply rooted in our individual psychological profiles.

Expressing your personal purpose, often encapsulated in a purpose statement, finds its footing in three primary drivers.

## Whom do you aim to impact?

The impact we seek to make differs based on our psychological profile, finding meaning across individual, organizational, or societal levels.

## Why do you seek to make an impact? 

Our motivation to create change is rooted in our core values, shaping our vision of a fair and just world. Whether fostering harmony or karma, our values drive our purpose.

## How do you make an impact?

Our talents shape the ways we approach problem-solving and influence change. Our purpose revolves around leveraging these abilities to create an impact in every facet of our lives.

Purpose isn't tied to a cause; it's intrinsic to our motivations, talents, and values. Your purpose can be seamlessly applied to any goal, profession, or role. It's not just a static noun; it's an active verb driving our actions.

Fulfillment, on the other hand, stems from living in sync with our purpose, resonating with our intrinsic motivations. This sense of fulfillment is biologically crafted by neurochemicals like oxytocin and dopamine, rewarding behaviors crucial for our survival.

To achieve fulfillment, align your personal purpose with three fundamental sources:

ðŸ’‘ Nurturing meaningful relationships.
ðŸš€ Making an impact that resonates deeply with you.
ðŸŒ± Personal growth and development.

When these three components coalesce and you're attuned to their presence, a profound sense of fulfillment blossoms.

Developing a Purpose Mindset stands as the linchpin for attaining fulfillment at work. It's a belief system that empowers us to shape our lives in service of humanity and the planet.

Individuals with a Purpose Mindset believe that work and education can serve as meaningful conduits to make a positive impact in the world. Conversely, those with a Transactional Mindset view work and education merely as means to an end, focusing on financial or social status gains.

Cultivating a Purpose Mindset proves challenging once a Transactional Mindset takes root.

Self-awareness is pivotal in understanding our purpose. Greater awareness empowers us to proactively shape our lives. Reflecting on experiences and connecting them to our feelings and insights creates meaning. Without this process, experiences tend to deplete us, leading to burnout.

Awareness of our purpose forms a scaffolding, making it easier to connect experiences with personal significance and relate them to other facets of our lives.
