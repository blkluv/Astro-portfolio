As of a result of a majority of companies not being invested in the spiritual well being of their employees that are lacking purpose, states like [Georgia[https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/georgia-has-unhappiest-employees-nation-according-new-survey/AXWZPCWMCRFTJCC6AXMITETLHE/] have the most unhappiest workers in the country. Unhappy workers, on a spiritual level, emit a low frequency of energy in their lives, which can be felt by customers and other employees. This low frequency of energy level spreads to everyone interacting with the company, leading to negative reviews, unfavorable word-of-mouth recommendations, and customer losses.

Companies worldwide are experiencing substantial, yet unquantified, financial losses due to the failure to maintain their employees' higher vibrational levels. To tackle this issue, we prioritize spirituality at the organizational summit by offering free Web5 training to those seeking elevation.

We incentivize participation in our complimentary Web5 classes by awarding attendees with One $LUV, our unique Web5 spiritual currency unobtainable through purchase. 

One $LUV symbolizes the unity of the world through love, inspired by visionaries like Bob Marley and Dr. Martin Luther King, who presented these ideals over 50 years ago. Despite society's previous lack of receptiveness and the limitations of technology back then, which primarily connected humanity through TV and radio frequencies, the answers to global unity were already public knowledge.

## Business Plans Are Spiritual

It starts with a business plan aimed at manifesting currency, often facilitated by an angel investor aka VC. This intricate process operates on a spiritual plane, relying on our faith in our words and the power of our imaginationâ€”our innate ability to shape the worlds we desire to create. 

I have proof in this to be true with documentation of a blank check to my nonprofit with the amount of $9M that I kept on my phone screen for four years even after raising $20M in capital. All of the documentation our three year jouney of manifesting spiritual currency will tokenized as LUV NFT to be sold and told as a story of our journey reserved for LUV NFT holders.

This spiritual practice is encapsulated in an 'Affirmation,' exemplified as 'I AM,' which also parallels a technological programming code. How? Our advanced technology mirrors the digital twin of our spiritual systems. All of this advanced technology was made in the spiritual image of man. From our social media algorithms, cell phones to currency which started with bartering back in ancient Kemet. Early Egyptologist studied and clone documents of our ancestors advanced technology and monetized it by creating tech such as Web2.
