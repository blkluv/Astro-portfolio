Technical Interviews are, without doubt, the most loathed part of the interview process. For many, they are the sole thing that deters them from applying at many top companies, barring them from earning a higher salary or a better work life balance. 

### The current state of interviews
There are two main ways programming ability is measured in an interview process. Either a take home assignment, or a technical interview. These each have their pros and cons, but with the advancement of AI, it is reasonable to believe that one could complete a take home test without real knowledge of what they are completing. With that said, I don't think that the current technical interview is perfect by any stretch, but here are some suggestions.

### The structure is actually pretty good
In terms of measuring coding ability and thought process, a real time interview is the companies best bet. With hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, it is fair to assume that cheating on an asynchronous project or interview is commonplace. While I agree with the way the interview is held, I don't agree with the questions that are asked, or the expectation placed on the interviewee.

### My suggestion
If the goal of the technical interview is to simply see how candidates would go about solving a problem, and the steps they would take to reach a conclusion, there should not have to be code written and tested. Memorizing sorting algorithms, their time complexity, and how to implement them should not be the benchmark for earning a well paying job. Instead, companies should care more about the thought process of the candidate, and their ability to fully think problems through with the businesses goals in mind. It is well understood by programmers that the ability to ask good questions is more important than the ability to write the code.

### Make them think
In technical interviews, rather than asking a common leetcode question, ask them one that pertains to the specific companies goals, and observe the questions they ask and the reasoning behind their solution. The ability for an employee to function with the good of the company in mind is highly undervalued.


#### Conclusion

As a whole, technical interviews get a bad rap because people feel as though it doesn't reflect a true working environment, a lot like teaching barring students from using calculators on math tests, the barring of using the internet on technical interviews will never make sense to many. If you break it down, though, technical interviews actually have a great structure for weeding out candidates, but the questions need to be much more generalized and take into account specific company goals.
