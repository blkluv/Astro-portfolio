When I initially started going to the gym, I never thought about what would make me quit. It wasn't something I ever considered until after it happened. Why would I stop? It makes me feel good, look good, gives me confidence, and is a place to socialize with friends. Regardless of all that, I slowly removed it as a priority and began going less and less until it was a month in between sessions. While it was not a single thing that made me quit, a conversation with my mom opened me up to a profound idea. 

My first time in the gym was by accident. I went to play basketball with some friends just for fun and ended up throwing around some weights. I liked the way it felt, the atmosphere, the people, and the soreness that followed, so I went back again. And again. And again. For four months from September to December, I religiously went to the gym, tracking my workouts and what I was eating. I saw incredible results in a short amount of time and while I was proud of what I now saw in the mirror, It wasn't close to the sole reason I kept going back. That is, until it was. 

At the end of December, everyone that I haven't seen since the summer comes home from college and reconnects during the two week winter break they gave us. Since I've been making big changes, fast, I looked and acted completely different from four months ago (I gained nearly 25 pounds during this time) and, like any human (don't lie), I wanted to reap the social rewards of my hard work. I earned it. I wore short sleeves under my coat, puffed my chest out a bit, and wore a tighter sweater to church. I wasn't looking to be the center of conversation, but I liked getting validation from people I respected and people who I know meant it.

The overjustification effect, in behavioral psychology, is defined as *italics*.
